## Get started

This project uses [SST](https://sst.dev/) to manage the Infrastructure. To develop on this app you will eventually need AWS User credentials. If you're part of AOE, just ask one of the maintainers to get a token, if not you can follow [the SST Guide](https://sst.dev/docs/aws-accounts) to create your own Account.
